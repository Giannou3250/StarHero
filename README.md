# StarHero
- This repository includes all C# code for game rules and game logic of the 2D space shooter "Star Hero" that I developed in Unity.
- The intention of this repository is to share the process in which i developed the game by sharing the code files here for other devs of computer programmers to glean from in order to help those who would like to develop games for their first time. It is also to show the process of how I created the game.
- Other unity assets such as sprites, game objects and audio sources cannot be displayed here as they are linked to the Unity UI of my project. However all backend work on the game objects are demonstated here in C#.
- game files are heavily commented to provide full clarity to viewers as to what each line of code represents 
- Link to the game is here available for download - https://george3250.itch.io/star-hero
